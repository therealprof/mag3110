mag3110
=======

_mag3110_ contains an [embedded-hal][] compliant hardware abstraction or driver
for the I2C based NXP MAG3110 magnetometer. This chip can e.g. be found on the
[BBC micro:bit][] board and an example use can be found in my [microbit
crate][].

The driver is hardware agnostic and should (in theory) work with any
implementation of the [embedded-hal][].
