mag3110
=======

_mag3110_ contains the an [embedded-hal][] compliant hardware abstraction or
driver for the I2C based NXP MAG3110 magnetometer. This chip can e.g. be found
on the [micro:bit][BBC micro:bit] board and an example use can be found in my
[microbit][microbit crate].

The driver is hardware agnostic and should (in theory) work with any
implementation of the [embedded-hal][].
